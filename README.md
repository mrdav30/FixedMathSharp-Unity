## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Arithmetic with `Fixed64`:
```csharp
Fixed64 a = new Fixed64(1.5);
Fixed64 b = new Fixed64(2.5);
Fixed64 result = a + b;
Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: 4.0
```

### Vector Operations:
```csharp
Vector3d v1 = new Vector3d(1, 2, 3);
Vector3d v2 = new Vector3d(4, 5, 6);
Fixed64 dotProduct = Vector3d.Dot(v1, v2);
Console.WriteLine(dotProduct); // Output: 32
```

### Quaternion Rotation:
```csharp
FixedQuaternion rotation = FixedQuaternion.FromAxisAngle(Vector3d.Up, FixedMath.PiOver2); // 90 degrees around Y-axis
Vector3d point = new Vector3d(1, 0, 0);
Vector3d rotatedPoint = rotation.Rotate(point);
Console.WriteLine(rotatedPoint); // Output: (0, 0, -1)
```

### Matrix Transformations:
```csharp
Fixed4x4 matrix = Fixed4x4.Identity;
Vector3d position = new Vector3d(1, 2, 3);
matrix.SetTransform(position, Vector3d.One, FixedQuaternion.Identity);
Console.WriteLine(matrix);
```

### Bounding Shapes and Intersection
```csharp
BoundingBox box = new BoundingBox(new Vector3d(0, 0, 0), new Vector3d(5, 5, 5));
BoundingSphere sphere = new BoundingSphere(new Vector3d(3, 3, 3), new Fixed64(1));
bool intersects = box.Intersects(sphere);
Console.WriteLine(intersects); // Output: True
```

### Trigonometry Example:
```csharp
Fixed64 angle = FixedMath.PiOver4; // 45 degrees
Fixed64 sinValue = FixedTrigonometry.Sin(angle);
Console.WriteLine(sinValue); // Output: ~0.707
```

## üì¶ Library Structure

- **`Fixed64` Struct:** Represents fixed-point numbers for precise arithmetic.
- **`Vector2d` and `Vector3d` Structs:** Handle 2D and 3D vector operations.
- **`FixedQuaternion` Struct:** Provides rotation handling without gimbal lock, enabling smooth rotations and quaternion-based transformations.
- **`IBound` Interface:** Standard interface for bounding shapes `BoundingBox`, `BoundingArea`, and `BoundingSphere`, each offering intersection, containment, and projection logic.
- **`FixedMath` Static Class:** Provides common math functions.
- **`FixedTrigonometry` Class:** Offers trigonometric functions using fixed-point math.
- **`Fixed4x4` and `Fixed3x3`:** Support matrix operations for transformations.
- **`FixedMathSharp.Editor`:** Extensions for seamless integration with Unity, including property drawers and type conversions.

### Fixed64 Struct

**Fixed64** is the core data type representing fixed-point numbers. It 
provides various mathematical operations, including addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. The struct guarantees
deterministic behavior by using integer-based arithmetic with a
configurable `SHIFT_AMOUNT`.

## üß™ Testing and Validation

Unit tests are used extensively to validate the correctness of mathematical 
operations. Special **fuzzy comparisons** are employed where small precision 
discrepancies might occur, mimicking floating-point behavior.

To run the tests:
```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```
